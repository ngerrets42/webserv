# Example Server

This quick example server shows how to use socket(), bind() and listen(); and how to read simple requests made by browsers.

## Instructions:

 1. `Make`
 2. run `server.out`
 3. open browser and go to `localhost:<port>` (`<port>` is 8080 by default)
 4. You can now see the request header send by the browser in your console (stdout)

`ctrl-c` to close server
